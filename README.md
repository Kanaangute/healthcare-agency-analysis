# Healthcare Agency Performance Analysis

Analysis of 12,000+ Medicare-certified home health agencies using CMS performance data to identify quality drivers and improvement opportunities.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project analyzes healthcare agency quality ratings across the United States, examining:
- Performance by ownership type (Non-profit, Proprietary, Government)
- Geographic patterns and state-level quality variations
- Deep-dive case study: Massachusetts quality paradox

## 📊 Key Findings

- **National Average:** 3.24 stars out of 5
- **Ownership Performance:** Non-profit agencies outperform (3.36 stars) vs Government agencies (2.83 stars)
- **Geographic Disparity:** 2.13-star gap between best (SC: 3.88) and worst (MP: 1.75) performing states
- **MA Case Study:** Identified proprietary underperformance as root cause of low ranking (#45 out of 55)
  - 0.39-star deficit in proprietary agencies
  - Projected 20-position improvement if fixed

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** - Data analysis
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and cleaning
- **Streamlit** - Interactive dashboard (in progress)
- **Plotly** - Data visualization (planned)
